Mappo is a *work in progress* 2D tile map editor for retro games. Currently, only [VERGE](http://verge-rpg.com/) file formats are supported. A comprehensive set of command-line tools for loading and exporting all VERGE file formats (to PNG/GIF/JSON) are included.

# Why?

Grue showed me his cool [maped4](https://github.com/mcgrue/maped4) project. It exploded when I tried to use it, so I created this project to isolate the issues and understand why. Node and Electron and VERGE are cool, so I kept going. It's a fun way to probe unfamiliar territory (Node and Electron) with a familiar face (VERGE).

In ancient times, I worked on my own map editor. http://chuckrector.com/old/ So, I have a soft spot. Partly, this project is about "Can I do what I once did more easily?" Partly, it's also about "How much more powerful am I now?"

```
Triplefox | what is the plan for the loaders? just to have everything in json?
     @aen | binary formats can be viewed as a bit of a barrier
     @aen | conversion to json/png/whatever simply lowers that barrier
     @aen | and allows us all to stripmine everything
