# TODO

- option for `v3chr2gif` to generate reduced palette rather than requiring one
- export json/gif/png to the binary formats
- all cli accepting palettes as inputs should accept JSON palettes too
- handle file read errors, e.g. file doesn't exist (`readFileSync`, etc.)
- time for react/redux? ui updates getting complex. undo/redo may be easiest with redux
- export to TMX so i can test-drive Tiled features more easily

# TASKS

- loading mappo for first time should find all maps recursively in launch folder
- show all those maps to the user
- thumbnails of each map would be awesome
- a small summary of info next to each map would also be great
- clicking any map immediately loads it
- some messaging that drag & drop can load a map too
- drag & drop to load maps
